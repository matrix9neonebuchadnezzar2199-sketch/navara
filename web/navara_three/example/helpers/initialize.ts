 *
 * Currently that plumbing is scene-loaded signalling: the detail page
 * (`pages/detail/DetailApp.tsx`) renders the loading overlay over the demo
 * iframe and dismisses it when the demo posts SCENE_LOADED_MESSAGE. The page
 * counts as settled once every passed async-loading mesh has finished loading;
 * pages that pass none settle a short moment after setup. (Waiting for the
 * engine to fall idle is deliberately avoided: some pages drive it every frame
 * — a running `PersonViewPlugin` re-aims the camera each tick — so it would
 * never go idle and the overlay would hang forever.)
